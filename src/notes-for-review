[!- 'info' -!] is used to indicate comments
<!-- 'info' --> is used to indicate something that is no longer used


creating the project:
    ng new 'name_of_project'


generated a new component using the CLI:
    ng g c 'name_of_component'


<!-- to display the content of the newly created component(home) in the app's root i used the component selector inside app.component.css:
    <app-home></app-home> --> this was removed after i started setting up the routing


configuring routing:
    i already said yes to configure routing when the executing [ng new] so most of the code was done for me withing app-routing.module.ts

    i imported the home component:
        import { HomeComponent } from './home/home.component';

    and defined the route inside the routes variable:
         { path: '', component: HomeComponent }  [!- app-routing.module.ts -> line 6 -!]


creating a nav bar to navigate to Home:
    just added :
                <nav>
                    <a routerLink="home">Home</a>
                </nav>
                <router-outlet></router-outlet>
    to app.component.html 
        the <router-outlet></router-outlet> is where angular will know to render the component.


generated two more components:
    [!- refer to line 9 -!]
    reading-progress-tracker
    virtual-bookshelf


configured the routing for the two new components:
    [!- refer to line 17 -!]


adding bootstrap:
    cd to the main project file
        npm install bootstrap

    went to the angular.json file:
        modified "styles" [!- angular.json -> line 27 -]
        by adding "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"


adding a child routing to virtual-bookshelf:
    <!-- i cd into virtual-bookshelf and using the cli:
        ng generate module bookshelf-routing --flat --module=app --> this was totally wrong and created so much errors.
    so i deleted the whole bookshelf-routing.module.ts file. (app.module.ts made errors)

    just needed to go to the routing.module (app-routing.module.ts):
        and add within the route dict a new key called children and repeat the normal routing proses : [!- app-routing.module.ts -> line 14-]
            and import the components at the top.

    -generated two new components within virtual-bookshelf:
        [!- refer to line 9 -!]

        
working on the sidebar:
    went to [!- https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/examples/sidebars/ -!] and copied the styling.
        [!- review classes that was used-!]
    
    started using [ngClass]="{'class': condition}  
    [!- [ngClass]="{'active': someCondition['key'], 'nav-link text-white': true, 'nav-link': true}" -!] 
        with using a dictionary and (click)='navLinkColor("key")'

            [!- code -!]
                someCondition: { [key: string]: boolean } = {
                    bookshelf: true,
                    search: false,
                    dashboard: false,
                    settings: false,
                };

                current = 'bookshelf' //keeps track of what key value should be set to false

                navLinkColor(data : string){
                    this.someCondition[data] = !this.someCondition[data]
                    this.someCondition[this.current] = false
                    this.current = data
                }
